## Disclaimer
We have thoroughly tested the code to the best of our ability. However, we cannot guarantee it is completely error-free. Any remaining bugs or issues are unintentional, and we appreciate your understanding if any are discovered post-submission.

This type of disclaimer helps manage expectations by acknowledging potential issues without assuming liability for any errors. It’s similar to “errors and omissions” disclaimers used in many industries, which protect against unintended mistakes in content or work​.
